# Sandwich Club 

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What Did I Learn?
- JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## TODOs
- Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. 
- Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
